# Passmarked Firefox Extension (experimental)

The Passmarked Firefox Add-on anonymously queries the Passmarked API while the user visits their favourite sites. Showing the score in the address bar for quick reference.

When clicked the extension opens the latest test run on the domain the user is currently on. If no test has been run against the page, a test is started and the user redirected to the result page to view the score.

Only the domain is submitted to the Passmarked query API, excluding any user identifying information.
